# Brainwave

This fully responsive frontend project is a modern, UI/UX-optimized landing page for an AI application, developed using ReactJS with ViteJS and styled using TailwindCSS, based on a tutorial by JavaScript Mastery. The application features advanced visual interactions, including an interactive hero section where shapes react to the user's cursor and a subtle, smooth-scrolling Parallax effect. The design incorporates a dynamic Navbar with an animated hamburger menu for mobile devices, and leverages key components like service cards with gradient borders and a structured Bento Box layout to effectively present application features.

The project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of skills in building high-quality, high-performance interfaces. The complete structure addresses essential sections such as a pricing table and an application roadmap, utilizing a highly stylized aesthetic with grid lines and geometric shapes for a modern finish. This implementation ensures a 100% mobile-responsive design and a professional polish essential for showcasing a modern technological product.
